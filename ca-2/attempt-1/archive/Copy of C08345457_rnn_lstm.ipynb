No alternative data set or coding framework was used."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-grcBrQJPOd1"},"source":["## The Dataset\n","[Guardian News Articles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakharosekar2/guardian-news-articles)  dataset on Kaggle was used to perform genre or section analysis. Since this dataset was large (~150,000 articles / >700MB) the full dataset was not used. Instead only a proportion of the dataset was used. \n","\n","Aditya Kharosekar, the author of the dataset stated that no special preprocessing was done. Kharosekar said this was to give users of this dataset ability to preprocess this data in anyway they wish. About .3% of rows was found to be corrupted when inspected in excel. labels were also found to be catagorical strings. Two interesting feature columns for news classification were webTitle and bodyContent. webTitle was chosen as a feature to work with as bodyContent contained too many troublesome characters. webTitle also had less characters meaning training time should be slightly reduced.\n","\n","### Removed corrupted rows\n","Id on last row was read as 149,839. 149,723 rows remained, meaning 116 were removed. \n","\n","### Encoded categorical labels to an ordinal list\n","163 section names were found. A seperate key map list file was created called 'guardian_articles_labels.csv', with the original dataset recieving a new column containing an ordinal list of labels. Any N/A values were correct\n","\n","### Got 10% of data from the large dataset\n","In excl the rand() function was used to create a new column of random numbers. Then the entire dataset was ordered by smallest random number. 10% of the dataset (149723 * 10%) or the top 14,972 rows were selected and exported into a seperate file called guardian_articles_ten_perc.csv. This file will be used for further processing.\n","\n","### Only selected webTitle\n","All other columns were removed except webTitle"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Text to
