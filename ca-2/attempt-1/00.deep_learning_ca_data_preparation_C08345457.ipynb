Since this dataset was large (~150,000 articles / >700MB) the full dataset was not used. Instead only a proportion of the dataset was used. \n","\n","Aditya Kharosekar, the author of the dataset stated that no special preprocessing was done. Kharosekar said this was to give users of this dataset ability to preprocess this data in anyway they wish. About .3% of rows was found to be corrupted when inspected in excel. labels were also found to be catagorical strings. \n","\n","There were 164 unique section names. Two interesting feature columns for news classification were webTitle and bodyContent. webTitle was chosen as a feature to work with as bodyContent contained too many troublesome characters. webTitle also had less characters meaning training time should be slightly reduced.\n","\n","### Removed corrupted rows\n","Id on last row was read as 149,839. 149,723 rows remained, meaning 116 were removed. \n","\n","### Encoded categorical labels to an ordinal list\n","164 section names were found. A seperate key map list file was created called 'guardian_articles_labels.csv', with the original dataset recieving a new column containing an ordinal list of labels. Any N/A values were correct\n","\n","### Got 10% of data from the large dataset\n","In excl the rand() function was used to create a new column of random numbers. Then the entire dataset was ordered by smallest random number. 10% of the dataset (149723 * 10%) or the top 14,972 rows were selected and exported into a seperate file called guardian_articles_ten_perc.csv. This file will be used for further processing.\n","\n","### Merged webTitle with bodyContent\n","To simplify the dataset all other columns were removed except webTitle, bodyContent and label. Two smaller datasets were created to test results. The first one had webTitle and bodyContent combined in the same column seperated by a white space. The second just had webTitle."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"m3iIeARvu5xA"},"source":["## Access data from google

No wonder more Scots want to leave the UK | Adam Ramsay No one should be surprised that support for Scottish independence is surging. A year ago this week, Conservatives rallied behind a leader capable of rekindling an old flame. A leader whose very purpose was to assert against all the evidence that England or Britain â€“ theyâ€™re never sure which â€“ stands alone against the forces of history. A leader who would inflame the UKâ€™s oldest arguments. Europe looked on in horror. In Scotland, we gritted our teeth. During the 2019 general election, called five months after Johnson took the helm of the Tory party, he lost more than half of his partyâ€™s seats in Scotland. Rather than look reality in the eye and follow the example of its neighbour, England set its house on fire, giving Johnson a thumping win. Our homes are semidetached, so when you burn, so do we.\\nIt was clear that the Corbyn project was dead, and with it any chance to seriously reform the British state. The organised Scottish left â€“ who have played a shaping role in British politics ever since they founded the Labour party â€“ drifted back to the independence cause. Labourâ€™s left turn had attracted many of the young activists who did so much to drive support for independence in 2014, delivering a slew of seats back to the party in 2017. After the 2019 election, one leading Labour thinker told me heâ€™d gone in the space of a month from independence ambivalence to â€œfull zoomerâ€\\x9d â€“ online slang for the most vocal fans. The polls followed. In January, two surveys in a row gave independence a clear lead. Then Brexit officially happened, and a different demographic drifted towards yes. Many of the middle-class voters previously sceptical about independence but furious about the leave vote had clung to the idea of a second European referendum. It was the final branch keeping them in the unionist tree. On 30 January that branch snapped. Then the pandemic hit, putting into sharp relief what has always been true about devolution: it allows the Scottish government some flexibility, but only within a framework set by Westminster. Our lockdown was stricter, but couldnâ€™t have started earlier: Scotland doesnâ€™t have a Treasury with the power to deliver its own furlough scheme. The Scottish governmentâ€™s messaging is better, with the steps out of lockdown laid out much more clearly. But Boris Johnson is still our prime minister, and there are still some who pay more attention to him than to Nicola Sturgeon, making radical differences in rules difficult to enforce. I live in Edinburghâ€™s seaside suburb of Portobello, and itâ€™s clear that many people have allowed Englandâ€™s lifting of lockdown to govern the timing of their beach trips, rather than Scotlandâ€™s greater caution. Our pandemic death rate is notably lower than Englandâ€™s. But itâ€™s hard not to look to our safer-still nearest neighbours â€“ Ireland and Norway â€“ and wonder where weâ€™d be if we too were independent of the failing British state. Weâ€™ll never know the answer to that question but I can tell you this: itâ€™s nice to feel like at least one of my governments cares if I live or die. Sturgeon has managed the politics of the crisis well, appearing open, honest and caring at a time when Johnson lurched between bluster and solemnity.\\nFor the generation of us who grew up with the Scottish parliament, this was always the basic case for independence: look to Holyrood and you see representatives negotiating over the best interests for the various peoples who elect them. It does some things well, and others badly, but it does them in the open and you can have it out when they mess up. With its proportional-ish voting system and no pretensions to superpower status, itâ€™s a bog-standard northern European democratic chamber rather than an absurdist neo-feudal theatre that is still coming down from the adrenaline rush of losing its empire. Look to Westminster, and itâ€™s another story entirely: a maze of dark corridors, where lobbyists run riot, reporters from billionaire-owned papers trade in gossip and the people the parliament is meant to represent struggle to get a word in. The pandemic has made it clearer than ever that politics is a matter of life and death. And so thousands have looked at it with fresh eyes. Support for Scottish independence has never had the kind of sustained support it has had in recent months. Boris Johnson has helped drive this trend, and his tour of Scotland is likely to go down like an uncovered sneeze. And so soon, the people of England are going to have to decide: will you force us to live in your house? Or are you ready to let us decide our own future once again? â€¢ Adam Ramsay is co-editor of openDemocracy.net UK and author of 42 Reasons to Support Scottish
