problems affect one in four of us at any one time. Though accurate figures can be difficult to obtain, it is estimated that 450 million people worldwide have a mental health problem. What is mental illness? There are more than 200 clinically diagnosable mental health conditions, very roughly organised into five major categories. These are: mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, eating disorders and dementia. Depression is the most common mental illness. The World Health Organisation estimates that by 2020 depression will be the second leading cause of disability globally, after heart disease. Other common mental illnesses include: general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and anorexia. Lesser known, but just as debilitating, conditions include trichotillomania (a compulsion to pull out one’s hair) and pica (the eating of non-edible items). Different conditions are more prevalent in different parts of the globe. Obsessive compulsive disorder is three times more likely to occur in Latin America than in Africa. Japan has high rates of schizophrenia. How do I know if I am unwell? It is normal to feel sad, angry, upset, frustrated, confused – so how do we know if what we’re experiencing is indicative of a more serious problem? “When it starts to screw up our life,” says Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and chair of psychological medicine at King’s College London. “When we are not just anxious – we can’t go into a shop, can’t use the tube, can’t talk to someone without crippling panic attacks. Or when we are not just sad, we can’t get out of bed, we eat too little or too much, when we can’t concentrate on the simplest of tasks, and when we start to think about harming ourselves.” We all have worries about our appearance, but spending hours in front of a mirror or obsessing on a specific perceived default, to the detriment of a social life, could be a sign of body dysmorphic disorder or another anxiety issue. Shifts in appetite (whether increased or decreased), sleep pattern (again, more or less), a loss of interest in pleasurable activities (including sex) can all be signs of depression. Jonny Benjamin, a film-maker, has schizoaffective disorder, which combines elements of schizophrenia, mania and depression. Benjamin used to hear voices as a child, a sort of internal commentary on events. “The voice changed and it became more of a devil. It would challenge me to do certain things – so I might have to move an object from one place to the other, or I would be punished,” he says about the onset of his illness. Of course, not everyone with a mental illness will hear voices. Not everybody who is depressed will cry. Symptoms manifest themselves in various ways. Conditions will sometimes also present differently according to age and gender. The other thing to remember is that, as Wessely explains, “some people lack insight into the fact that they are ill, but it is obvious to everyone else around them”. If people you trust suggest you are becoming unwell, it might be worth consulting your GP. What causes mental illness? As with a lot of things, mental illness seems to be a combination of nature and nurture. However, there are genetic risk factors for certain conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. But the fact that some conditions run in families may be as much to do with social factors as genes. Rates of mental illness tend to double after humanitarian disasters and changes in our lives or physical illness might also contribute to the onset of mental ill health. But there is no specific catalyst for any mental health condition.\\nWill I be diagnosed? It can be really helpful to look up information online when curious about mental health, but be careful of self-diagnosis. In the same way you wouldn’t entrust a Magic 8 ball to confirm a pregnancy, you wouldn’t entrust WebMD to tell you what’s going on in your brain. It might be useful, however, to jot down some thoughts before visiting your GP. It’s possible you may be referred to specialist care and come into contact with community psychiatric nurses or psychotherapists. It can take a long time to be diagnosed with a mental health condition – the average for bipolar disorder is 13.2 years. Wessely warns that diagnosis is “the beginning, not the end. Everyone we see shares something with someone else who has had the same illness – be it OCD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but everyone is also an individual. “Psychiatry is about bringing together all of this to come up with as best as we can an understanding of why did this person get ill with this disorder at this time.” How will I be treated? Ideas around mental illness have thankfully changed greatly over the course of history. For instance, women’s “hysteria” is no longer treated with vibrators. Mental health conditions are treated with medication and therapeutic intervention, but there are numerous issues around both treatments. Research into mental health drugs is chronically underfunded, psychiatrist recruitment is at an all-time low and no therapeutic discipline is a panacea. Again, Wessely says, it is about working to the needs of an individual. “It is about recognising a pattern and then drawing on the results of research from all around the world. So we can say that if you have, for example, claustrophobia – an inability to tolerate confined spaces – then I know from other patients and the literature that cognitive behavioural therapy is going to help you, but taking a sedative like Valium won’t.” Can I recover? Yes. People can recover entirely from periods of mental illness, and many people learn to manage chronic conditions. Try to remember this if recently diagnosed: it can get better. Stephen Buckley, head of information at Mind, says: “What recovery means to you will be personal, but for most people, the most important thing is to find ways to live the kind of life you want.”'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.sectionName[50]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"id":"aRhrpg7stbRi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683122015605,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Robert O'Sullivan","userId":"06333551652984277057"}},"outputId":"c896f3da-6071-4249-edcd-51a279a94d2a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'UK news'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["savefilename = filename[:-4]+ \"_\" + str(int(round(sample_size_perc*100,0))) + \"_perc.csv\"\n","print(savefilename)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lQqBjjyT7BPL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683122822052,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":869,"user":{"displayName":"Robert O'Sullivan","userId":"06333551652984277057"}},"outputId":"0e31a4af-f525-422a-b3ee-2ba1070bd17c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/data/guardian_articles_10_perc.csv\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#save sample to csv file\n","df.to_csv(savefilename, sep=',', encoding='utf-8', index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"pbEw6R2tWJ3E"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
