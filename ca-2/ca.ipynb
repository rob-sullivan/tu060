    "## Introduction\n",
    "The goal of the project was to perform a systematic investigation of a number of Deep Learning methods in the context of text processing tasks, and benchmark these methods against classical methods where appropriate. The following was provided: a report and source code complete with a link to Google Colab is contained within a .zip file provided and trained models using Keras / TensorFlow. No alternative data set or coding framework was used."

Since this dataset was large (~150,000 articles / >700MB) the full dataset was not used. Instead a proportion of the dataset (random 10%-20%) was used."
