    "*Set Theory* is a field of mathematics which deals with group membership. Items are said to either **belong** or not **belong** to a set. You may remember venn-diagrams from your early school days. These are an application of set theory.\n",

    "\n",
    "A set tells us whether something belongs to a particular group or not. There is **no concept of duplicates** in sets. Each set can contain an item at most once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because sets only tell us whether something belongs to a group or not there is **no concept of order** in sets. Two sets with the same items are identical, regardless of the order in which we write them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets, Supersets, Subsets\n",
    "Anyone taking this course belongs to the set of all students. \n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all students contains students of TU Dublin, students of UCD *etc.*. \n",
    "\n",
    "You all belong to the specific **subset** *students of TU Dublin*. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are all taking the *TU123* course; every student taking *TU123* is also a student of TU Dublin, so the set  *TU Dublin students* is a **superset** of *TU123* students (and the set *TU123* students is a **subset** of *TU Dublin Students*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Operations\n",
    "A **Union** B is the set of everything in **either** A or B\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Intersection** B is the set of everything in **both** A and B\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Minus** B is the set of everything in A that is not also in B\n",
    "\n",
    "The **symmetric difference** between A and B is everything in either A or B, but not both\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Reading\n",
    "You don't need an exhaustive knowledge of sets to work with Python. But if you're interested in finding out more this [website](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter1/1_2_0_review_set_theory.php) gives a very good introduction."
