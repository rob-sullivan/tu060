#We are using a .dat file (survey.dat) created from the SPSS file survey.sav  taken from SPSS Survival Manual 6th Edition Julie Pallant
#http://spss.allenandunwin.com.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/data-files.html#.Wb0vvnWP-po
#Results on a survey on well being
#We need to load the file so that we can use it in R.
sdata <- read.table("survey.dat")

#Setting the column names to be that used in the dataset
colnames(sdata) <- tolower(colnames(sdata))

needed_packages <- c("VIM", "tidyverse")                      
# Extract not installed packages
not_installed <- needed_packages[!(needed_packages %in% installed.packages()[ , "Package"])]    
# Install not installed packages
if(length(not_installed)) install.packages(not_installed) 
library("VIM")
library("tidyverse")


```
## Visualise the missing data level and pattern
```{r}
#These are our variables of interest - the nine continuous variables
varsint<-c("toptim",     "tmast", "tposaff", "tnegaff", "tlifesat", "tpstress","tslfest", "tmarlow" , "tpcoiss" )


sdatasubset<-sdata[varsint]#create a subset of data with just the variables of interest
summary(sdatasubset)#Get our summary statistics - these are just for us not for publication

#Create and inspect patterns of missingness
res<-summary(VIM::aggr(sdatasubset, sortVar=TRUE))$combinations

#Output the most common combinations
head(res[rev(order(res[,2])),])
```
We have 9 variables: "toptim",     "tmast", "tposaff", "tnegaff", "tlifesat", "tpstress","tslfest", "tmarlow" , "tpcoiss" 
We can see the most common pattern is where all variables are have data - no missing data
The next most common is where tpcoiss alone is missing - 5 cases
Then when tpstress alone is missing - 3 cases
Then when tmarlow is missing - 2 cases
Then 1 case where all variables are missing
*** There is no real pattern to this missing data

## You can create a matrix plot 
```{r}
VIM::matrixplot(sdatasubset, sortby = 2)
```

## You can create tables to look at patterns of missing data in continuous for nominal
## Or use some of the packages available in  https://www.tidyverse.org/
