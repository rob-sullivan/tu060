### Friedmans ANOVA (non-parametric) for repeated measures
## SETUP
```{r setup}

#We are using diet.dat (Taken from Discovering Statistics with R, Andy Field)
#created from the .sav version available at https://studysites.uk.sagepub.com/dsur/study/default.htm
#adapted to work as a dataframe on load

#Does the 'andikins' diet work?
#Variables
#Outcome: weight (Kg)
#Time since beginning the diet
#At Baseline (start)
#At 1 Month
#At 2 Months

#read in the data
diet <- read.table("diet.dat")
#treat our data as a matrix
Responses <- na.omit(with(diet, cbind(month1, month2, start)))
cat("\nMedians:\n")#display the heading Medians
#print out the medians of each of our variables
print(apply(Responses, 2, median)) 
#conduct the friedman test
stats::friedman.test(Responses)

#Conduct post-hoc tests as needed
```
