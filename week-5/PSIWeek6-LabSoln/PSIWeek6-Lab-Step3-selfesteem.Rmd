## 1. H0: There are no differences between total self-esteem scores for respondents in Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3. HA: There are differences between  total self-esteem scores for repondents in Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3.
### Step 1: Examine/Assess Normality
```{r tslfest-normality}

#We will allocate the histogram to a variable to allow use to manipulate it
gg <- ggplot(survey, aes(x=tslfest))
gg <- gg+ggtitle("Figure 1 - Histogram for Total Self-Esteem")

#Change the label of the x axis
gg <- gg + labs(x="Total Self-Esteem")

#manage binwidth and colours
gg <- gg + geom_histogram(binwidth=2, colour="black", aes(y=..density.., fill=..count..))
gg <- gg + scale_fill_gradient("Count", low="#DCDCDC", high="#7C7C7C")

#adding a normal curve
#use stat_function to compute a normalised score for each value of tslfest
#pass the mean and standard deviation
#use the na.rm parameter to say how missing values are handled
gg <- gg + stat_function(fun=dnorm, color="red",args=list(mean=mean(survey$tslfest, na.rm=TRUE), sd=sd(survey$tslfest, na.rm=TRUE)))

#to display the graph request the contents of the variable be shown
gg

#Create a qqplot
qqnorm(survey$tslfest, main="Figure 2 - QQ Plot for Total Self-Esteem")
qqline(survey$tslfest, col=2) #show a line on the plot


#stat.desc is a function from pastecs - make sure you include the basic switch=F to ensure you don't get scienfitic notation
pastecs::stat.desc(survey$tslfest, basic=F)

#We can make our decision based on the value of the standardised score for skew and kurtosis
#We divide the skew statistic by the standard error to get the standardised score
#This will indicate if we have a problem
tpskew<-semTools::skew(survey$tslfest)
tpkurt<-semTools::kurtosis(survey$tslfest)
tpskew[1]/tpskew[2]

tpkurt[1]/tpkurt[2]

#and by calculating the percentage of standardised scores for the variable itself that are outside our acceptable range
#This will tell us how big a problem we have
# Calculate the percentage of standardised scores that are greated than 1.96
# the perc function which is part of the FSA package which calculate the percentage that are within a range - you can look for greater than "gt", greater than or equal "geq", "gt", less than or equal "leq",  or less than "lt"),
# scale is a function that creates z scores, abs gets absolute value

ztslfest<- abs(scale(survey$tslfest))

FSA::perc(as.numeric(ztslfest), 1.96, "gt")
FSA::perc(as.numeric(ztslfest), 3.29, "gt")

```
### Report assessment of normality

<p style="text-align:justify">
Total self-esteem scores data was assessed for normality. Visual inspection of the histogram and QQ-Plot (see Figure 1 and Figure 2) identified some issues with skewness and kurtosis. The standardised score for kurtosis (`r round(tpkurt[1]/tpkurt[2],2)`) can be considered acceptable using the criteria proposed by West, Finch and Curran (1996), but the standardised score for skewness (`r round(tpskew[1]/tpskew[2],2)`)  was outside the acceptable range.  However over 100% of standardised scores for total self-esteem and associated sensation fall within the bounds of +/- 3.29, using the guidance of Field, Miles and Field (2013) the data can be considered to approximate a normal distribution (m=`r round(mean(survey$tslfest, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, sd=`r round(sd(survey$tslfest, na.rm=TRUE),2)`, n=`r length(survey$tslfest)-sum(is.na(survey$tslfest))`).

### Differences more than 2 groups - Parametric Tests
#### ANOVA
##### Describe Total self-esteem by group (Group 1, Group 2, Group3 agegp3)

```{r Describe}
#Get descriptive stastitics by group - output as a matrix
psych::describeBy(survey$tslfest, survey$agegp3, mat=TRUE)

#Conduct Bartlett's test for homogeneity of variance in library car - the null hypothesis is that variances in groups are equal so to assume homogeneity we would expect probability to not be statistically significant.
stats::bartlett.test(tslfest~ agegp3, data=survey)
#p value is > 0.05 so the result is not statistically significant so we can assume homogeneity


#Conduct ANOVA using the userfriendlyscience test oneway
#In this case we can use Tukey as the post-hoc test option since variances in the groups are equal
#If variances were not equal we would use Games-Howell
userfriendlyscience::oneway(as.factor(survey$agegp3),y=survey$tslfest,posthoc='Tukey')

res1<-userfriendlyscience::oneway(as.factor(survey$agegp3),y=survey$tslfest,posthoc='Tukey')

#use the aov function - same as one way but makes it easier to access values for reporting
res2<-stats::aov(tslfest~ agegp3, data = survey)
#Get the F statistic into a variable to make reporting easier
fstat<-summary(res2)[[1]][["F value"]][[1]]
#Get the p value into a variable to make reporting easier
aovpvalue<-summary(res2)[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][[1]]
#Calculate effect
aoveta<-sjstats::eta_sq(res2)[2]
                
#In the report we are using the res2 variable to retrieve the degrees of freedom
#and the eta_sq function from the sjstats package to calculate the effect
#A statistically significant difference was found so we need to examine and report the post-hoc results also.
```


### Reporting the results with eta squared effect

<p>
A one-way between-groups analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to explore the impact of age on levels of self-esteem. Participants were divided into three groups according to their age (Group 1: 29 yrs or less; Group 2: 30 to 44 yrs; Group 3: 45yrs and above).  There was a statistically significant difference at the p < .05 level in total self-esteem scores for the three age groups: (F(2, `r round(res2$df.residual,2)`)= `r round(fstat,2)`, p<0.05.  Despite reaching statistical significance, the actual difference in mean scores between groups was quite small. The effect size, calculated using eta squared was small (`r round(aoveta[[1]],2)`). Post-hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated that the mean score for Group 1 (M=`r round(mean(survey$tslfest[survey$agegp3=="18 - 29"], na.rm=TRUE),2)`, SD=`r round(sd(survey$tslfest[survey$agegp3=="18 - 29"], na.rm=TRUE),2)`) was significantly different to that for Group 3 (M=`r round(mean(survey$tslfest[survey$agegp3=="45+"], na.rm=TRUE),2)`, SD=`r round(sd(survey$tslfest[survey$agegp3=="45+"], na.rm=TRUE),2)`). Group 2 (M=`r round(mean(survey$tslfest[survey$agegp3=="30 - 44"], na.rm=TRUE),2)`, SD=`r round(sd(survey$tslfest[survey$agegp3=="30 - 44"], na.rm=TRUE),2)`) did not differ significantly from Group 1 or Group3.
