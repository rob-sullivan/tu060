## Introduction

This report was a detailed analysis of the student performance dataset collected by (Cortez, et al, 2008). Its purpose was to demonstrate a systematic and in-depth understanding of concepts, methods and data analysis methodology.

The report followed a standard methodology that covers the entire span of data analysis methodology that is applicable to the dataset. Correct methods were selected for different context. Any choices made throughout the report were justified, where possible and any difficulties or limitations were discussed, where known. Application of selected methods were also discussed, interpreted and critically evaluated. Conclusions were drawn from the outcomes of our analysis and domain-level implications of outcomes were synthesised. Any conjecture made in the report is stated with recommendations for further analysis. The report adhered to NFQ Level 9 standard (QQI, 2018), where possible, such as knowledge kind requirement: "a critical awareness of current problems and/or new insights, generally informed by the forefront of a field of learning". Academic Referencing was placed at the end of this document and any references made can throughout the document can be found there in detail.
