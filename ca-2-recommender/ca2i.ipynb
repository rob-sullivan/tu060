    "H&M Group is a clothing business with 53 online markets and approximately 4,850 stores. They are concerned that customers might not quickly find what interests them or what they are looking for, and ultimately, they might not make a purchase. They want to enhance the shopping experience and help customers make the right choices. They think they can also reduce transportation emissions if they reduce customer returns. H&M want product recommendations based on data from previous transactions, as well as from customer and product meta data.\n",

    "Submissions will be evaluated according to the Mean Average Precision @ 12 (MAP@12). They will make purchase predictions for all customer_id values provided, regardless of whether these customers made purchases in the training data. They explain that customers who did not make any purchase during test period are excluded from the scoring.\n",
    "There is no penalty for using the full 12 predictions for a customer that ordered fewer than 12 items. They encourage to make 12 predictions for each customer.\n",

    "\n",
    "H&M are expecting about 1,371,980 prediction rows, we will only have 1,362,281 because 9,699 customers have not purchased anything yet. We will also have to make predictions on these customers without knowing their transaction history. We could look for customers with similar demographics but this may be computationally expensive and a big assumption, that similar demographics purchase similar products."

However We could have hundreds of users and thousands of products. A user may not have tried every product so our table would have missing values. To solve this issue we would need to predict the value for missing cells (rhat_ij). A good prediction would mean a good recommendation to the user. Another way to make recommendations to users would be to rank the top k products for each user. This would be based on information we have available on products and users.

    " * We used the last 3 weeks in September 2020 from our transaction dataset to be used later for training and testing data.\n",
    " * We used Customer attributes, the full date range (YYYY-MM-DD) and transaction attributes as features to predict products.\n",
    " * We filled in missing data in our customer attributes using SimpleImputer to impute most frequent categories and median was used to impute missing ages.\n",
    " * We split our data up by time instead of random assignment. This meant 2 weeks (in the past) were used for training and 1 week (in the future) was used for testing testing\n",
    " * We encoded our categorical data using the LabelEncoder and date feature by converting the date into an ordinal number. This was after the training/test split.\n",
    " * We created our training and testing datasets and scaled them using MinMax range (0 to 1)\n",
    " * To build the KNN Classifier model, we used k=5 and our metric was minkowski p2, This meant we calculated the distance using eucledian distance formula.\n",
    " * To evaluate the model, we used accuracy as a measuring score. Which compared our predicted products to what was in the test dataset.\n",

    " * We included product attributes in with Customer attributes, the full date range (YYYY-MM-DD) and transaction attributes as features to predict products. This lead to curse of dimensionality. The KNN Classifier performs poorly with too many features. For the next test we should reduce the amount of features we have. To do this we must use dimension reduction techniques such as principle component analysis (when we have lots of features) or singular value decomposition (SVD) when we have sparse data.\n",

    "Third H&M KNN Classifier Model Accuracy increased to 0.422 and Precision Score increased to 0.151:\n",
