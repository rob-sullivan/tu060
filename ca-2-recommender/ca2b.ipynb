    "In a perfect scenario for recommendation systems we would have a table of m users by n items, with each product given a rating r_ij by each user. However We could have hundreds of users and thousands of products. A user may not have tried every product so our table would have missing values. To solve this issue we could predict the value for missing cells (rhat_ij). A good prediction would mean a good recommendation to the user. Another way to make recommendations to users would be to rank the top k products for each user based on information we have available on products and users.In essence the prediction problem boils down to how we rate products. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order for us to rate products we will first need some metric to rate them by. Secondly, we will decide the prerequisites that a product must meet to recieve a rating. Thirdly we will calculate the score for each item that satisfies the prerequisites and finally we will output a list of items in decreasing order.\n",

    "We will create a new table for each item, how many customers bought the item and at what price. We will then rank each product on how many were sold. Before we do this, must consider an issue that will arrise with this recommendation system. If 100 customers bought product A and 10 customers bought product B but both products cost ten euros, our system would rate these two products with the same popularity rating. This is not ideal since the product that has more customer purchases would be more popular. We must instead use a weighted rating (WR) that takes into account the number of customers who bought a product. \n",
