    "# Similarity-Based Learning Lab - focus on Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity-based learning is a family of algorithms which follows the intuition that similar items have similar labels. We can tell that items are similar by coming up with some notion of **distance** between instances. A distance function takes two instances as inputs and returns a number representing the distance between (or dissimilarity) between the two instances. Instances with a low distance are considered to be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common similarity-based algorithm is the k-Nearest-Neighbours (kNN) algorithm. When predicting a label for instance *q*, this algorithm looks for the *k* closest (most similar) instances, and predicts the majority label for these instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we'll build distance functions for some of the most popular distance metrics. Along the way we'll learn how to write clean, *pythonic* code. We'll go on to build our own kNN model from scratch (don't worry, it's easier than you think!). Finally, we'll look at the tools Sci-kit Learn provides us for normalising our data, an essential preprocessing step for similarity-based learning models.\n",

    "A **distance metric** is a function which takes two *instances* and returns a number describing the dissimilarity, or *distance* between those instances. We saw that there are a few other rules which distance metrics need to obey (such as the triangle inequality) to be truly considered *metrics* and not similarity indexes. The reason for this is that if any of these laws are violated, we couldn't plot these instances on a graph.\n",

A function allows us to take in any number of parameters (in this case, the instances we want to measure) and return a value, (in this case, the distance).

    "\n",
    "Now that we've got a name we need to think about parameters. We can see from the equation above that the Euclidean distance function takes two parameters. In the example above, they're called *p* and *q* but we can give them more descriptive names if so choose. \n",

    "Finally, it's good practice to make it clear what type of data your function expects and returns returns. This is an optional extra feature in Python known as **type annotation**. Type annotation makes it clear to you, to other developers, and to your IDE what type of data is going to come back from the function when it's called. This can be very helpful in that it allows your IDE to give your intelligent hints when you code. See PyCharm for more details.\n",
