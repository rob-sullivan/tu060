# Homeostatic Reinforcement Learning Simulator 
Created by Robert S. Sullivan in 2023 using Python 3.8.10.
Adapted from Mehdi Keramati's HomeoSim. Keramati's simulator 
was called *escalation of cocaine-seeking in the homeostatic 
reinforcement learning framework*. It was created by Keramati 
in March 2013 using Python 2.6 to mimic experimental cocaine data.
This simulator incoporates open ai gym to allow deep Q learning, 
which is a value based off policy reinforcement learning technique
that makes use of deep neural networks for value approximation.
